               to any specific type of photography, I wanted this site to be nonchalant, and
               exemplify a sense of self-discovery, like it’s figuring itself out because that’s
               how I am with my own photography.

            <p>This project went through five stages: Brand Development, Web Design, Motion Graphics,
               Development and Mobile Development. I was aware that mobile design and development should
               have been concurrent with the overall site design, but at the time, I chose to focus on
               figuring out the best way to showcase big, high-res images, leaving a mobile layout out of
               scope for the moment. So, I set it up to do at a later time.

            <h1>APPROACH</h1>
            <h2>Stage 1: Branding</h2>
            <p>The main challenge when it came to developing my
               photography brand was designing the logo. I use the moniker kyletakesphotos
               because I don’t consider nor like calling myself a “photographer.” As I take
               pictures just for fun and not professionally, I wanted my logo to not take itself
               seriously. When it comes to taking photos, some of my best shots have come from
               just randomly pointing my camera and firing the shutter. Evidence that I am
               definitely not a professional.
               <br> <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="desktop-left">
               <br>
               After about a week of sketches, playing around with fonts and letter layouts and
               asking for feedback from my instructor and classmates, I was pleased with my final
                result. My logo seems organized, but the letters are a bit off which I really like.
                It looks like it’s trying to figure things out, which I am with my photography. In addition
                to the main logo, I also produced an icon to be used when the logo is too big to be used (e.g.
                social media display photo, favicon, etc.). Once finished, I took another week to create my
                branding guidelines: selecting my colors, typography, hierarchy, and more to go with my brand.

            <h2>Stage 2: Web Design</h2>
            <p>
               The intention of this website was to simply show off my photos. I could have gone with a simple
               grid view of all my images but as this was my own personal passion project, I wanted to have
               fun with it but also challenge myself a bit. Aesthetically, I knew it would be very minimal, as
               per my brand, so my goal was to show off a bit of my creative personality with the layout.
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="img-label-wrap-med">
               <img style="max-width:500px" src="../img/cases/kyletakesphotos/early_home_wireframe.png" alt="Early Wireframe">
               <h4>EARLY HOME PAGE WIREFRAME</h4>
            </div>

            <p>
               My home page went through several iterations. Initially, I had a more
               condensed grid layout, but
               after developing the page and putting sample images in, I realized this didn’t give any breathing
               room to my photos.
               <br><br>
               With this in mind, my goal became to create an art exhibit-like layout,
               with a few centerpiece images and various other images scattered throughout. Like how you walk around an
               art gallery, letting the size of the art and their placement guide your way, I envisioned users scrolling
               through and being drawn to whatever catches their eye. I’ll likely never have my own art exhibit, so this
               is as close as it’ll get.
            </p>


            <p><br>For the individual gallery layouts, after some trial and error, I landed with
               having them all with the same grid layout but rearranged in different places for each different gallery. This juxtaposes the main
               layout, which is all scattered and seemingly random whereas the individual gallery is neat and conformed.
               The layouts of my images wouldn’t have sat well with me if they were all the same so this juxtaposition
               strikes a balance between the two.
            </p>
            <div class="img-label-wrap-full desktop-left">
               <img class="lil-shadow" src="../img/cases/kyletakesphotos/gallery_wireframe.png" alt="Gallery Wireframe">
               <h4>PORTRAIT GALLERY WIREFRAME</h4>

               <img class="lil-shadow" src="../img/cases/kyletakesphotos/gallery_wireframe2.png" alt="Gallery Wireframe">
               <h4>WHATEVER GALLERY WIREFRAME</h4>
            </div>

            <p>Lastly for the about page, I went for a bold and dynamic approach to balance out my very minimalist site (because
               just a white background with some text and a photo of me would be too easy and boring). For this, I decided to
               have my face take up two-thirds of the background and place the ‘about me’ text to the side. I think I
               accomplished what I sought out to do because it still takes me aback when I visit that page.

               <h4>ABOUT PAGE MOCKUP</h4>
            </div>

            <h2>Stage 3: Development</h2>

            <p>Since my website is simple and static, development was an easy, yet tedious task. I developed the site in just vanilla HTML and CSS, as well as Javascript and JQuery later on when I implemented the photoviewer and the motion graphics. Part of the reason I wanted a different photo layout was to have more practice using CSS Grid, which made placing my images where I wanted to precisely incredibly simple.
               For the home page layout, I used a <strong>12fr</strong> column grid, with rows measuring <strong>112px</strong>. I set it up like this in order to match my mockup.
            </p>
            <div class="img-label-wrap-full">
               <img class="lil-shadow" src="../img/cases/kyletakesphotos/home_wireframe_grid-overlay.png" alt="Home Page Wireframe with CSS Grid Overlay">
               <h4>HOME PAGE WIREFRAME WITH CSS GRID OVERLAY</h4>
            </div>

            <blockquote>Looking back on it, and with more development experience under my belt, I realize this wasn’t the best way to do this, but hey, lesson learned.</blockquote>
            <p>
               For the individual gallery layouts, I used a six column grid, with the columns measuring the same
               size as the rows to ensure they were all square-shaped.
            </p>
            <div class="img-label-wrap-full">
               <img class="lil-shadow" src="../img/cases/kyletakesphotos/gallery_wireframe_grid-overlay.png" alt="Gallery Page Wireframe with CSS Grid Overlay">
               <h4>GALLERY PAGE WIREFRAME WITH CSS GRID OVERLAY</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
               Lastly, the about page was simply defining a 3x3 grid and placing elements where they needed to be. Though, setting up the (oh-so beautiful) image of my face was tricky since the div it was contained in is skewed. To fix this, I just had to skew the image the opposite way (in Photoshop) so when the CSS rule skews it, it looks normal.
            </p>

               <h4>ABOUT PAGE MOCKUP WITH CSS GRID OVERLAY</h4>
            </div>

            <h2>Stage 4: Motion Graphics</h2>
            <p>
               The biggest hurdle for this part of the project was the page transition  animation. I had an idea of what it looked like in my head, and since I was a one-man band for this project, there wasn't any need to spend time prototyping it. For the animation, I used JQuery, specifically the animate function to make the transition div swipe through, fade in the logo, and then swipe and fade out. This transition takes place when the user navigates to another page.
               <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Stage 5: Mobile Design + Development</h2>
            <p>
               As with most mobile layouts, I wanted the mobile version to resemble and contain as many elements from the desktop version as possible. My main challenge became figuring out the best way to make the navigation suitable for mobile devices. Like most things during this project, I could have gone the conventional route and implemented a hamburger menu. But I felt a menu bar would distract from my images so I opted for a menu button containing my icon logo. I knew it wouldn't be immediately obvious what the button would do, but after testing it with some users, I concluded it was a harmless interaction (open/close the navigation menu) that wouldn’t affect the user experience. Design-wise,the mobile layouts are all reminiscent of their desktop counterparts.
            </p>
            <div class="img-label-wrap-left">
               <img class="lil-shadow" src="../img/cases/kyletakesphotos/mobile_home_wireframe.png" style="max-width: 414px" alt="Mobile Home Page Wireframe">

               <h4>MOBILE NAVIGATION</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
               As I initially made this website for desktop only, adapting the code for mobile was a very tedious task, as I had to refactor the code in order for the site to take a mobile-first approach. This involved developing the mobile version first, then refactoring my initial code into media queries.

            <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>
               First and foremost, mobile-first when designing websites. I knew of this at the time I started designing my website, but at the time, I didn’t want to create more work for myself than necessary as I had other projects on the go. Though I now fully understand this thinking, mainly from a developer’s point of view.
               <br><br>
               Second, testing designs before development. There were times when I did, avoiding a headache during development, and other times I didn’t, where I just had to buckle down and dive headfirst into code, cursing out my designer self. Like the first point, this was something I was aware of: how changes during design are less costly than changes during development. However, what seemed to look good in the design, didn’t pan out when I went on to code it. An example of this is when I developed the main page after just one iteration, and realizing the photos felt congested. This website was for a web development class, so at the time, testing wireframes/mockups wasn’t a recurring thought as it is now (after taking more design courses).
               <br><br>
               Lastly, and this piggybacks on the previous point, I learned the importance of understanding the scope of a project, and taking the proper steps before proceeding to the next stage. Over the course of this project, I often would look forward to the next stage, before completing the current stage. I think because this was a personal project, which I had full reign over, I was excited to do everything and try different things. This resulted in me underlooking and overlooking details, which would either would extend the next phase of the project or unnecessarily revisiting the design.
