               WISHES is a mobile application that helps guide users through the unpleasant task of writing out their <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/family-social-supports/seniors/health-safety/advance-care-planning">Advance Care Plan</a>.
               It seeks to simplify the tough questions, and aids people in organizing their thoughts into one handy document right in their phone.
               <br><br>
               In an day where death is rarely thought about—let alone planned for—WISHES aims to simplify the process of creating a will
               and putting a plan in place in the event of an untimely passing.

               This was a small group project that spanned across two different courses. Hilary and I collaborated throughout the project, with one of us
               taking the lead at each stage. Hilary lead more of the early, visual and UX/UI stages of the project, whereas I lead the UI/development.
               Hilary delves into more detail on the UX side of things in her case study, which can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hilaryromans.com/wishes/">here</a>.

            <h1>Process</h1>

            <h2>Problem Exploration</h2>

            <p>
               Our UX methods followed a linear approach in furthering our understanding of the problem. The time we had for this project did not allow us to conduct
               the extensive research and user testing we would need in order to fully realize this product. With that in mind, we had to make some assumptions along the way.
               <br><br>
               Our starting point was a user journey map, depicting a scenario where WISHES would come in handy.
            </p>

            <div class="img-label-wrap-full">
               <img style="max-width:1081px" src="../img/cases/wishes/Wishes-Journey-Map.png" alt="WISHES Journey Map">
               <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
            </div>

            <p>
               From here, we generated two personas that represent our potential users: the older person looking to get their
               thoughts and wishes in order; and the young person, who probably doesn't think much about death.
            </p>

            <div class="img-label-wrap-full desktop-left">
               <img style="max-width:501px" src="../img/cases/wishes/Lady-Persona.png" alt="WISHES Persona 1">
               <h4>Persona: Elderly Lady</h4>
            </div>

               <h4>Persona: Young Chap</h4>
            </div>

            <h2>Userflow</h2>

            <p>
               As WISHES is a single functionality app, we wanted to keep the number of steps minimal and focused. Users
               enter their information, record their answers, (digitally) sign it and finally have two witnesses sign it.
               As previously mentioned, we made an assumption here about the legality regarding digital signatures. As there
               was a legal grey area around this and we had no immediate plans to launch the app, we simply proceeded as if it
               were allowed and legal.
            </p>

            <div class="img-label-wrap-full">
               <img style="max-width:1081px" src="../img/cases/wishes/Wishes-User-Flow.png" alt="WISHES Userflow">
               <h4></h4>
            </div>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>

            <div class="img-label-wrap-full">
               <img style="max-width:1081px" src="../img/cases/wishes/Wishes-Wireframes.png" alt="WISHES Wireframes">
               <h4></h4>
            </div>

            <h2>Mockups and Interactions</h2>

            <p>
               Once the wireframes and visual design were finalized, we created mockups and a simple prototype to see what
               the app would look and feel like. The simple prototypes we created would later aid us during the development
               process.
            </p>

               <h4>Witness Signatures</h4>
            </div>

            <h2>App Development</h2>

            <p>
               Development for our app was done in basic HTML/CSS/JS, and deployed with PhoneGap. Since we had the mockups and interactions
               completed, development was a relatively simple task: layout the structure in HTML, make it look like
               our mockups with CSS, then make the darn thing work with Javascript. <strong>However, we realized quickly that we were a bit too
               ambitious with our initial userflow.</strong> Given the scope of our project and the time we had, we felt it was not worth the time
               to figure out how to implement an account system. So we dropped that feature to figure out another day. As well, by this point in the
               project, we did not have the time to properly implement saving the user's progress so they can edit it later. So our app became a one-and-done
               type of app.
            </p>

            <p>
               Since our app was made in basic web development tools, we made it available to view online. <strong>Note:</strong> We designed it for the iPhone X, so the
               experience may differ if viewed on mobile or on a browser size that isn't 375 by 812.
            </p>

            <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

            <p>
               Completing this project further refined my design process and developed (ha) my understanding of web development. Working with another designer
               helped highlight what areas of product design I like and am good at, something I'm still always questioning as my design career is in
               its early stages. As well, it provided an opportunity to practice explaining and backing my design decisions in a team setting. Lastly, Hilary and I learned
               early on how complex even a simple application can be, and the amount of work that goes into the handling of data. We
               both now have a greater appreciation for the work of IAs and developers, and we can design more thoughtfully with this basic understanding of how web applications function.
