               The purpose of this project was to create a website to showcase my photography as
               well as to embody my creative persona. As I am a casual photographer and not tied
               to any specific type of photography, I wanted this site to be nonchalant, and
               exemplify a sense of self-discovery, like it’s figuring itself out because that’s
               how I am with my own photography.

               This project is inspired by images of old photographs, juxtaposed with modern times. Named after the ancient Greek historian, Herodotus,
               the idea of "DOTUS" <em>(pronounced dot-tus) </em> is to give the user a glimpse of what older times looked like at a famous landmark, or even just an ordinary street.
               There are many directions this project could have gone in. In the end, it became a simple 360-camera view, where you visit a spot, look around through
               the app and see old images superimposed (where they happened in history) as you move your device around. Though another option I came up with during conceptualization, was
               a photo-diary app, where the old image is on the screen, and users align the old photo to modern day.
               <br><br>
               My end goal for this project was to find a use case for such an app, and create a demo of how it would work.
